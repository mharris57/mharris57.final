                <h2>History of GPUs</h2>
                    <p>
                     A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized circuit designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing. The concept began in the 1950s, with significant developments in the 1970s through large-scale integration (VLSI), leading to the creation of the first personal computer graphics display processor. The modern GPU was introduced in 1999, primarily for rendering smooth graphics in videos and games. Today, GPUs are integral to many computing devices and are increasingly used for AI and parallel computations. This evolution represents a remarkable journey of technological advancement and innovation.
