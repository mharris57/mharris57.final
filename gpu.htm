            <p>Explore how we acquire our GPUs</p>
            <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Purchases from Manufacturers:</strong> We have strong relationships with leading GPU manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD. This allows us to purchase GPUs directly from them, ensuring that we always have the latest models in stock.</li>
        <li><strong>Partnerships with Distributors:</strong> We also work with a network of trusted distributors to source GPUs. This helps us to maintain a diverse inventory and meet the varied needs of our customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Integrations:</strong> Some of our GPUs are sourced from complete servers made by Dell, Supermicro, and Gigabyte. These servers come integrated with Nvidia GPUs, providing us with another reliable source of high-quality GPUs.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Trade-Ins:</strong> We offer a trade-in program where customers can exchange their old GPUs for store credit. This not only provides our customers with a cost-effective way to upgrade their GPUs, but also allows us to offer pre-owned GPUs at a lower price point.</li>
    </ul>
